# AdSense-Income-local

This is a local version of the bots,
It will run on a home server VM, rather than EC2

### To run:
`python primary-local.py`


### To exit the bots running (`primary-local.py`):
create a file in this directory name `exit`, they will stop (please note they will stop after the current bot has finished - not during)


### TODO:
- Create div links so the bots visit the site, then visit the ads
- Create a way to randomize the time spent on a site
- Create a way to randomize what ad is clicked on the site
- list all sites (all 10 pages of [my site](https://adsense-income-cryptoidcoder.netlify.app/))
