# Ads - Passive Income


### **Main Idea:**
- Website With Ads;
- Bots that visit the site (traffic);
- URL's that divert via the ads;

<hr>

### **Website:**
Availabe @: https://adsense-income-cryptoidcoder.netlify.app/
Hosted Using: Netlify

Hosted on Github Pages / Heroku / ~~Custom Hosting~~
- This Means that github pages & heroku would be free - but with limited traffic

- Would be multiple pages, each one with ads

<hr>

### **Bots:**
Hosted on AWS / Google Cloud
- Scaleable
- Different IP Addresses each time it visits the site
- Python & Selinium

Each time a bot is run:

1) Check / Get New IP (Can't be the same as any that are on a centralized list (gh repo / Bitwarden Note {add the current ip and update file, meaning used IP's are always listed}) )

2) Visit Dummy Sites (This is to deter Captcha Events); Facebook, Instagram, Cat Videos?

3) Visit My site; Page 1 -> Page 2 -> Page 3. Etc... When on a page "randomly" click some of the links.
- Minimum 10 Pages
- 10000 Views Per Month
- 50% Ad Click Rate



4) Visit Prebuilt, Pre-Existing Ad Sites: https://surveysatrap.com/get-paid-to-click/

### **Replication:**
Is smart enough to see how much its making VS cost to upscale.
- Looks up Using Google API how much has been made from ads (May have to calculate based on views&reports?)
- Compares that to Cloud costs to scale by 2x,5x,10x,20x,50x,100x
- If the scale-up cost is within 10% of the overall earnings then scale up.
